## Electronic Structure Methods Project

### Graphene Nano-ribbons

Code for the final project in electronic structure methods. The project is about topological edge states in graphene nano ribbons (GNR).

The tree's from the taskblaster workflows have not been uploaded so any interested party will have to run the taskblaster workflows themselves to fully recreate the data.
